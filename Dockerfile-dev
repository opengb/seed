### Install JavaScript requirements - do this first because they take awhile
### and the dependencies will probably change slower than python packages.
### README.md stops the no readme warning
COPY ./package.json /seed/package.json
COPY ./vendors/package.json /seed/vendors/package.json
COPY ./README.md /seed/README.md
# unsafe-perm allows the package.json postinstall script to run with the elevated permissions
RUN npm install --unsafe-perm

### Install python requirements
WORKDIR /seed
COPY ./requirements.txt /seed/requirements.txt
COPY ./requirements/*.txt /seed/requirements/
RUN pip uninstall -y enum34
RUN pip install -r requirements/local.txt
# for remote debugging
RUN pip install remote-pdb
# for live reloading celery
RUN pip install watchdog[watchmedo]


### Copy over the remaining part of the SEED application and some helpers
WORKDIR /seed
COPY . /seed/
COPY ./docker/wait-for-it.sh /usr/local/wait-for-it.sh
